            <li>Motivation is the drive to achieve your goals or needs.</li>
            <li>
              Motivation is important to break old habits and to develop healthy

              Many people struggle with getting and staying motivated,

              depression or anxiety.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may find it helpful to set specific, measurable goals that you
              can divide into small steps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask your family and friends to support you and help you stay

              It can be tough going in this world we have created. Former lovers
              sue each other, companies fire people to increase the bottom line,

              The key is to stick with what you’ve started. It’s kind of like

              several, but by writing one page at a time, you will complete the
              book and feel pretty great about yourself. Progress is a great

              Sadly, there are things we can do nothing about, but we have a lot
              more control over our own moods and actions than most people

              If you don’t think you will make it, it could become a
              self-fulfilling prophecy. Research says that up to 80 percent of
              our thoughts are negative, and that needs to change. When you
              learn to recognize your negative thoughts, you can begin to think
              more positively, which will make you feel better about yourself
              and your life. Imagine having 80 percent positive thoughts!

              When Murphy’s Law is in full force, you may wonder why you are
              even trying. The truth is that successful people in all walks of

              deal. The trick is to not let disappointments stop you. Ever.

          <h2>A brief explanation of the practice.</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            How do you learn to meditate? In mindfulness meditation, we’re
            learning how to pay attention to the breath as it goes in and out,
            and notice when the mind wanders from this task. This practice of
            returning to the breath builds the muscles of attention and
            mindfulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return
            to, and remain in, the present moment—to anchor ourselves in the
            here and now on purpose, without judgement.

            The idea behind mindfulness seems simple — the practice takes
            patience. Indeed, renowned meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg
            recounts that her first experience with meditation showed her how
            quickly the mind gets caught up in other tasks. “I thought, okay,
            what will it be, like, 800 breaths before my mind starts to wander?
            And to my absolute amazement, it was one breath, and I’d be gone,”
            says Salzberg.
